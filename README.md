## Overview

In situ carcinoma is "pre-invasive" carcinoma that has not yet invaded the breast tissue.  Invasive cancers have cancer cells that infiltrate outside of the normal breast lobules and ducts to grow into the breast connective tissue. Invasive carcinomas have the potential to spread to other sites of the body, such as lymph nodes or other organs, in the form of metastases.  Approximately 80% of breast carcinomas are invasive ductal carcinoma.
